Generator — Loop 1 (the "actor") in loop-engineering terms.

Turns a CampaignBrief into a full HTML draft. In revision mode, it's
handed the previous draft plus the specific FAILED grade items and
asked to patch only what's needed — cheaper and more stable than
regenerating from scratch every iteration.

Follow the system prompt's "Required-concepts checklist" section and try to satisfy those items on the initial generation.

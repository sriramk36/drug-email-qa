"""
Grader — Loop 2 (verification loop) in loop-engineering terms.

Deliberately NOT an LLM call for the blocking rules. Structural
compliance checks (is the AE box there, is the audience tag there, did
the brand name leak into unbranded copy) are things regex/DOM parsing
can check exactly and reproducibly. Saving the LLM for judgment calls
keeps the audit trail auditable — a human reviewer can see precisely
why something failed, not just an LLM's opinion that it failed.

IMPORTANT: market/audience resolution (regulatory.py) can now involve
an LLM call for genuinely unrecognized free-text input. That call
happens exactly ONCE per pipeline run, upstream, in pipeline.py — not
here. Rules receive the already-resolved MarketInfo/AudienceInfo as
plain data via GradingContext. This keeps the grader's core guarantee
intact: grading itself never makes a network call, regardless of how
the inputs it's checking against were resolved.

Every rule function has the same signature:

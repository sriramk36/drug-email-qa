"""
Pipeline orchestrator — wires Loop 1 (generate) to Loop 2 (grade) with
a bounded revision loop, and logs every attempt for Loop 4 analysis.

Resolution (market/audience free text -> structured info, with LLM
fallback for anything the dictionary doesn't know) happens exactly
ONCE here, before generation even starts. The resolved MarketInfo/
AudienceInfo then gets threaded through as plain data to the generator
and grader — neither of them re-resolves anything, which is what keeps
the grader's "zero LLM calls" guarantee true regardless of how exotic
the input market/audience text was.

IMPORTANT: `approved_for_production` on the result is hard-coded False.
Passing every automated check means the draft is structurally
complete, not that a qualified MLR reviewer has approved the clinical
claims, fair balance, and final copy. Don't let a UI or a future
version of this script quietly repurpose "all checks passed" as
"safe to send" — that decision has to stay with a human. The optional
soft_review notes are even further from that: a second AI's opinion,
advisory only, never a verified finding.

"""
Trace logger — Loop 4 (hill-climbing loop) in loop-engineering terms.

Every pipeline run appends one JSON line per iteration to traces.jsonl:
which rules failed, on which brand/market, on which attempt number.
Run `python analyze_traces.py` after you've collected some runs to see
which rules the Generator struggles with most — that's your signal for
which part of prompts/generator_system.md to sharpen next, instead of
guessing.

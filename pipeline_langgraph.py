"""
LangGraph version of pipeline.py — same nodes, same logic, different
orchestration mechanism. This is NOT a generic "here's how LangGraph
works" example: every node calls the exact same generator.py/grader.py/
regulatory.py/soft_review.py functions pipeline.py does. Nothing about
the generation, grading, or resolution logic changes — only how the
control flow between them is expressed.

WHY THIS VERSION EXISTS (vs. the plain-Python pipeline.py):
pipeline.py's loop was a defensible "just a while loop" when it was 3
steps (generate -> grade -> revise). Now that resolution can branch
into an LLM call or not, and there's a genuinely separate soft-review
step, that's 4 nodes with real conditional routing — closer to where
LangGraph's actual value (declarative graph structure, and free
step-by-step tracing via .stream(), see __main__ below) starts to
outweigh the extra dependency. Ship whichever one matches what you're
being evaluated on: pipeline.py is easier to explain line-by-line in
an interview; this one is easier to extend if you're adding more nodes
later (e.g. loop 3's event trigger calling this graph from a queue
consumer) or if a client specifically wants LangGraph on the resume.

Graph shape:

    resolve --> generate --> grade --(not done, not stuck, iter<MAX)--> generate
                                 |
                                 +--(all_passed OR stuck OR iter>=MAX)--> soft_review --> END
